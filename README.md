# mAkeCM Day: Web Application Workshop
This workshop will be an overview of common patterns for front-end web application development.  Attendees will work with Node.js® and Angular using HTML, SCSS and TypeScript to create a custom, interactive portfolio web application.
## Prerequisites
You should have a basic knowledge of programming and navigating the command line.  Due to the limited amount of time available, you are expected to have the following software installed on your device before the workshop:
 - [x] **Node.js®** (https://nodejs.org/en/)
 - [x] Any code editor; recommended:  
**Visual Studio Code** (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
 - [x] (*optional*) **Git** (https://git-scm.com/download/)
## Getting Started
Start by downloading the project template for the workshop from GitHub:  
https://github.com/speedacm/mAkeCM-WebApplicationWorkshop 

If you’re unfamiliar with GitHub, follow the link above and click on the “Clone or download” button, then choose “Download ZIP”.  Once your download is complete, extract the contents anywhere on your computer.

Open the folder `/my-portfolio` in your preferred code editor.  (Visual Studio Code is recommended, so instructions will be written assuming that's the code editor you're using.  If you're not using Visual Studio Code, then it's expected you're familiar enough with your system to perform equivalent actions.)  Now that the project is open, press `` Ctrl+` `` to open the terminal.

Install the Angular CLI using the terminal:

    npm install -g @angular/cli

Test the template by serving the application from the terminal:

    ng serve

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your preferred web browser to see your web application come to life!
